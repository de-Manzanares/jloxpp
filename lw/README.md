`lw` - Lox Walker - A C++ implementation of the tree-walking interpreter for the
"Lox" programming language from *Crafting Interpreters* by Robert Nystrom.

### What's Different?

#### In contrast with the original implementation:

- Identifiers may begin with, include, and end with any number of underscores.
    - This includes identifiers consisting entirely of underscores. Fun, huh?

- This implementation is not actually complete.

### Work in Progress

#### Status 

We've got a lexer. That's about it.
